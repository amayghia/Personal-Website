# AI Prompt & Dev Notes

## Prompt Log 1
**Prompt:** Scaffold a 6-page responsive portfolio with semantic HTML and one CSS file; include header/nav/footer, About, Resume, Projects, Contact with validated form + Thank You redirect.  
**AI Output:** Generated complete project structure with all HTML pages, responsive CSS with mobile-first approach, semantic HTML5 elements, and form validation JavaScript. Created proper folder structure (css/, images/, .prompt/) and implemented accessibility features like skip links, proper labels, and ARIA attributes.  
**Action:** Accepted — The AI provided exactly what was requested with proper semantic structure, responsive design, and form validation.

## 150-Word Reflection
AI sped up scaffolding, nav/footer consistency, and responsive CSS boilerplate. It reduced setup time and kept structure consistent across pages. However, it occasionally over-engineered solutions (extra scripts/styles) and suggested invalid attributes. I corrected these and ensured accessibility (labels, alt text, color contrast) and assignment compliance. I also replaced generic filler with my real content and simplified CSS where AI was verbose. The balance: use AI for speed on repetitive structure, but rely on my judgment for semantics, validation rules, and accurate personal details. I validated HTML/CSS, tested in two browsers, and verified the form UX on mobile.
